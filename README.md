# Minfys

Minfys is a free, open‑source mindfulness reminder that helps you stay present while working at your computer.

## Why use Minfys?

I built Minfys for myself—to stay more mindful, intentional, and productive—so I could both enjoy my time more and get better results.

When we sit at the computer, it’s easy to lose ourselves in the task at hand. Time slips away, our posture suffers, meals and breaks are forgotten, and we end up hammering away at problems instead of thinking them through.

In order to grow a habit of consciously being in the moment, Minfys can be used as reminder. It's core functionality is a basic timer, that makes a sound at user-defined intervals, to which you need to consciously react. But in order to prevent you from ignoring the sound with time, Minfys provides settings, to make it harder to ignore these. 

## How it works

Minfys uses a simple, customizable timer that chimes at intervals you set, gently nudging you to pause and refocus. To ensure those reminders stay effective:
- **Customize the alert:** choose your preferred volume.
- **Loop the audio:** have the chime repeat until you manually acknowledge it.
- **Enable auto‑launch:** start Minfys with your computer so it’s always running and ready to remind you.
